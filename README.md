## Getting Started

1. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with the following:
   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   Run the following SQL queries in your Supabase SQL editor in order:
   - `queries/01_create_users_table.sql`: Creates the users table with authentication
   - `queries/02_create_tasks_table.sql`: Creates the tasks table with all features

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Database Schema
